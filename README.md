# **Cartoon Detector**
*Project for fun / time-pass to utilize quarantine period* ðŸ˜œ  
A deep learning model that detects which cartoon is there in the image or video using YOLO(You Only Look Once) Object Detection algorithm
## Dataset
The dataset consists of 1472 images belonging to 5 different cartoon categories:
1. Shinchan - 336
2. Doraemon - 362
3. Detective Conan - 295
4. Mr Bean (animated) - 240
5. Naruto - 239  
#### Gathering Images
Images were downloaded using [**Bing Image Search API**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cognitive-services/bing-image-search-api/)  
Search queries included : "shinchan", "doraemon", "detective conan", "mr bean animated", "naruto"  
#### Annoting Images
Images were annoted using [**Label Img Tool**](https://www.arunponnusamy.com/preparing-custom-dataset-for-training-yolo-object-detector.html)  
## Deep Learning Model
I have used [**yolov2**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242.pdf) to train the model  
#### Training  
[**darknet**](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) - open source deep learning framework is used to train the model.  
Model was initialized with [**yolov2's pre-trained weights**](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)  
Configuration file **yolov2.cfg** was changed as follow:
```
237: filters=50
244: classes=5
```  
Model was initialized with following training parameters:  
```
learning_rate = 0.001  
decay = 0.0005  
momentum = 0.9  
```
*Model was trained for 250 Epochs on google collab using batch size of 64 and subdivision of 4*    
To train the model using darknet, run the following code:  
  `./darknet detector train cfg/cartoon.data cfg/yolov2.cfg weights/yolov2_pretrained.weights `    

*Accuracy*  
  - Region Avg IOU : 87.8429  
  - Class : 99.8973  
  - Obj : 84.0069  
  - Avg Recall : 100  
    
*Losses*  
  - Overall loss : 0.025661  
 #### Detection on Images
 To perform detection on image, run the following code:  
  `./darknet detector detect cfg/cartoon.data cfg/yolov2.cfg weights/cartoon_yolo.weights "path_to_img/img.jpg"`  
      
Input Image:  
![Input Image](https://github.com/jainamshah17/cartoon-detector/blob/master/Images/input.jpg)  
  
Output Image:  
![Output Image](https://github.com/jainamshah17/cartoon-detector/blob/master/Images/output.jpg)  
#### Detection on Video 
  *Required to compile darknet with opencv=1 in Makefile*  
  To perform detection on video, run the following code:  
  `./darknet detector demo cfg/cartoon.data cfg/yolov2.cfg weights/cartoon_yolo.weights "path_to_video/video.mp4"`
